The taxpayer is responsible for submitting special additional deduction information to the withholding agent. The withholding agent, in turn, is responsible for deducting taxes based on the information provided by the taxpayer and ensuring its accuracy. The taxpayer must report their deduction information to the withholding agent for processing and submission. The withholding agent processes these deductions during tax withholding and prepayment. Additionally, the taxpayer can entrust the withholding agent to handle the annual tax reconciliation on their behalf. If the taxpayer chooses to have the withholding agent manage the annual reconciliation, the withholding agent must conduct a written confirmation with the taxpayer by April 30, 2020.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
